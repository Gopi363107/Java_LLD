🧠 The 3 Golden Design Principles (Before SOLID)

Think of these as daily-life thinking rules for good code.

1️⃣ DRY — Don’t Repeat Yourself
🔑 Meaning (Simple)

Don’t write the same logic again and again.

If something is repeated → extract it.

🚗 Real-World Example

You are filling a college form.

❌ Bad:

You write your name & phone number on 10 pages manually.

✅ Good:

You fill it once, and the system copies it everywhere.

💻 Code Example

❌ Bad (Repeated logic):

double total1 = price + price * 0.18;
double total2 = amount + amount * 0.18;


✅ Good (DRY):

double calculateTax(double amount) {
    return amount + amount * 0.18;
}

🎯 Why DRY?

Easy to change

Less bugs

Cleaner code

2️⃣ KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid
🔑 Meaning (Simple)

Don’t make things complicated if simple works.

🏠 Real-World Example

To switch ON a fan:

❌ Bad:

Mobile app
WiFi
Login
OTP
Cloud server

✅ Good:

Just press the switch

💻 Code Example

❌ Over-engineering:

if (isUserValid == true && isPaymentDone == true && isTimeValid == true) {
    return true;
}


✅ Simple (KISS):

return isUserValid && isPaymentDone && isTimeValid;

🎯 Why KISS?

Easy to read
Easy to debug
Interviewers LOVE simple solutions

3️⃣ YAGNI — You Aren’t Gonna Need It
🔑 Meaning (Simple)

Don’t build features you don’t need now.

🍔 Real-World Example

You open a tea shop.

❌ Bad:

Ice cream machine
Pizza oven
Coffee machine
Bakery setup
(But customers only want tea ☕)

✅ Good:

Just make tea first
Add extras later if needed

💻 Code Example

❌ Bad:

class Booking {
    void book();
    void cancel();
    void reschedule();
    void refund();
    void loyaltyPoints();
    void internationalSupport();
}


(You only need booking now)

✅ Good (YAGNI):

class Booking {
    void book();
}

🎯 Why YAGNI?

Faster development
Less bugs
Less maintenance

🧩 How These 3 Work Together
Principle	Focus
DRY	No duplication
KISS	No complexity
YAGNI	No unnecessary features

👉 First apply DRY, KISS, YAGNI
👉 Then apply SOLID

🧠 Interview Tip (Very Important)

If interviewer asks:

“How do you design clean systems?”

Say:

“I follow DRY, KISS, YAGNI first, then apply SOLID principles.”

🔥 That sounds senior-level.
