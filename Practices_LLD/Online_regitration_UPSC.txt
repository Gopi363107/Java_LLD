✅ Real-World System: Online Exam Registration System (UPSC / University Level)
📌 Real scenario

Every year, lakhs of candidates apply for an exam.

Most candidate details are same

Only a few fields change (year, roll number, center)

👉 Creating objects from scratch is costly
👉 Prototype Pattern fits perfectly

🧠 How Prototype Pattern applies

Create a base candidate template

Clone it for each new candidate

Modify only required fields

🏗 System Design (Simple)
Entities

ExamApplication → Prototype

UPSCApplication → Concrete Prototype

ApplicationSystem → Client

✅ FULL REAL-WORLD CODE (Write this)
public class ExamSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Base prototype
        UPSCApplication baseForm =
            new UPSCApplication("India", "General Studies", "Offline", 2024);

        // Clone for Candidate 1
        UPSCApplication c1 = (UPSCApplication) baseForm.clone();
        c1.candidateName = "Gopi";
        c1.rollNumber = "UPSC001";

        // Clone for Candidate 2
        UPSCApplication c2 = (UPSCApplication) baseForm.clone();
        c2.candidateName = "Adithya";
        c2.rollNumber = "UPSC002";

        c1.print();
        c2.print();
    }
}

// Prototype interface
interface ExamApplication {
    ExamApplication clone();
}

// Concrete Prototype
class UPSCApplication implements ExamApplication {

    String country;
    String examType;
    String mode;
    int year;

    String candidateName;
    String rollNumber;

    UPSCApplication(String country, String examType, String mode, int year) {
        this.country = country;
        this.examType = examType;
        this.mode = mode;
        this.year = year;
    }

    @Override
    public ExamApplication clone() {
        return new UPSCApplication(this.country, this.examType, this.mode, this.year);
    }

    void print() {
        System.out.println(
            candidateName + " | " + rollNumber + " | " +
            examType + " | " + year + " | " + mode
        );
    }
}

🧪 Sample Output
Gopi | UPSC001 | General Studies | 2024 | Offline
Adithya | UPSC002 | General Studies | 2024 | Offline

⭐ How to explain in interview (2 lines)

In an online exam system, most application data remains the same for all candidates. Using the Prototype Pattern, we clone a base application object and customize only candidate-specific fields, improving performance and reducing object creation complexity.
