🔰 PHASE 1 — PATTERN 1: STRATEGY PATTERN

This is the MOST IMPORTANT pattern in LLD.
If you master Strategy, 50% of LLD becomes easy.

1️⃣ What PROBLEM does Strategy solve? (No code yet)
Imagine this situation:

You have a system that:

Does one thing

But that thing can be done in multiple ways

And new ways will be added in the future

Example ideas:

Payment → Card / UPI / Cash

Notification → Email / SMS / WhatsApp

Discount → Flat / Percentage / Festival

Sorting → Asc / Desc / Custom

❌ Bad Design (Without Strategy)

You usually see:

Big if-else

Or switch

Or logic scattered everywhere

Problems:

Hard to add new option

Violates OCP

Risk of breaking existing code

✅ Strategy Pattern Idea (In ONE line)

Encapsulate interchangeable behaviors and select them at runtime

Meaning:

Each “way” is separate

Core system doesn’t change

New behavior = new class

2️⃣ Real-World Analogy (VERY SIMPLE)
Travel Example 🚗🚆✈️

Goal: Go from A to B

Ways:

Car

Train

Flight

You don’t change your destination logic
You just change the strategy

3️⃣ When SHOULD you think “Strategy”?

If you see:

Many if-else

Same action, different logic

Runtime choice

Frequent changes

👉 Strategy is screaming here.

4️⃣ Strategy Pattern Structure (Mental Model)

There are 3 roles only:

1️⃣ Strategy (Interface)

Defines what to do

Not how

2️⃣ Concrete Strategies

Actual implementations

One responsibility each

3️⃣ Context

Uses the strategy

Doesn’t care which one

5️⃣ VERY IMPORTANT Interview Line (Memorize)

“I used Strategy Pattern to eliminate conditional logic and allow easy extension without modifying existing code.”

Say this → interviewer nods ✅

6️⃣ Common Beginner Mistake ❌

Mistake:

Creating strategy but still using if-else in main logic

Correct:

Choose strategy once

Use polymorphism

7️⃣ Where Strategy Appears (Everywhere)

You already used it (without knowing):

Notification system

Payment system

Discount calculator

👉 Strategy is not advanced
It’s fundamental

8️⃣ What We’ll Do Next (IMPORTANT)

We will follow this exact flow:

Step 1️⃣ Write BAD design (with if-else)
Step 2️⃣ Feel the pain
Step 3️⃣ Refactor to Strategy
