1️⃣ What are Structural Design Patterns?
🔹 Definition

Structural Design Patterns deal with how classes and objects are composed to form larger,
 flexible, and maintainable structures.

👉 They focus on structure, not creation or behavior.

2️⃣ Why Structural Patterns are Needed? (Problem)
Without structural patterns:
Tight coupling between classes
Difficult to change or extend systems
Code duplication
Poor scalability
Structural patterns help to:

✔ Combine objects flexibly
✔ Decouple components
✔ Reuse existing code
✔ Adapt incompatible interfaces

3️⃣ Where Structural Patterns Sit in LLD
Category	Focus
Creational	How objects are created
Structural	How objects are connected
Behavioral	How objects communicate

👉 Structural = Glue between objects

4️⃣ Types of Structural Design Patterns (GOF – VERY IMPORTANT)

There are 7 Structural Patterns:

Pattern	                                Purpose
Adapter	                Makes incompatible interfaces work together
Bridge	                Separates abstraction from implementation
Composite	            Tree structure for part–whole hierarchy
Decorator	            Adds behavior dynamically
Facade	                Simplified interface to complex system
Flyweight	            Reduces memory by sharing objects
Proxy	                Controls access to an object

5️⃣ Explanation of Each Pattern (Clear + Short)
1️⃣ Adapter Pattern
Purpose:
Convert one interface into another expected by client.

Analogy:
🔌 Mobile charger adapter

Used When:
Integrating legacy code
Third-party libraries

Example:
USB → Type-C
Old API → New system

2️⃣ Bridge Pattern
Purpose:
Separate abstraction from implementation so both can vary independently.

Analogy:
🖊 Pen (abstraction) + Refill (implementation)

Used When:
Multiple dimensions of change
Avoid class explosion

3️⃣ Composite Pattern
Purpose:
Treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly.

Analogy:
📁 File & Folder

Used When:
Tree structures
Hierarchical data

4️⃣ Decorator Pattern
Purpose:
Add new behavior to an object at runtime without modifying its class.

Analogy:
☕ Coffee + Milk + Sugar

Used When:
Feature extension
Avoid subclass explosion

5️⃣ Facade Pattern
Purpose:
Provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.

Analogy:
🎮 TV Remote

Used When:
Complex APIs
Improve usability

6️⃣ Flyweight Pattern
Purpose:
Reduce memory usage by sharing common objects.

Analogy:
🅰 Characters in text editor

Used When:
Large number of similar objects
Memory optimization

7️⃣ Proxy Pattern
Purpose:
Provide a placeholder to control access to an object.
Analogy:

🛂 Security guard

Used When:
Lazy loading
Access control
Logging, caching

6️⃣ Why Structural Patterns are IMPORTANT? (Interview Answer)

Structural patterns are important because they:
Improve flexibility
Reduce tight coupling
Promote code reuse
Help scale large systems
Make systems easier to modify

👉 They are heavily used in real-world systems

7️⃣ Where Structural Patterns are Used? (Real Systems)
✔ Software Engineering

UI frameworks (Swing, JavaFX)
Spring Framework (Proxy, Facade)
Hibernate (Proxy, Flyweight)

✔ System Design

Payment gateways
Microservices
Middleware layers

✔ Everyday Examples

API gateways → Facade
ORM → Proxy
UI components → Composite

9️⃣ One-Line Summary (MEMORIZE)

Structural Design Patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form flexible and reusable structures.
