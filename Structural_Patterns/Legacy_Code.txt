🔹 What is Legacy Code? (Simple Definition)

Legacy code is existing code that is already in production, works, but is hard to understand, modify, or extend.

Key point:

It works

But it is not easy to change

🧠 Simple Example

Imagine this code:

public class Payment {
    public void pay(int type) {
        if (type == 1) {
            // UPI payment
        } else if (type == 2) {
            // Credit Card payment
        } else if (type == 3) {
            // Net Banking
        }
    }
}


This code:

Is already deployed

Users are paying successfully

But…

❌ Adding a new payment method means modifying this class
❌ Violates Open–Closed Principle

👉 This is legacy code

🔍 Why Is It Called “Legacy”?

Because:

Written long ago

By someone else

Business depends on it

Changing it is risky

🚩 Characteristics of Legacy Code (Interview Gold)

Legacy code usually has:

❌ No proper documentation

❌ No unit tests

❌ Tight coupling

❌ Large classes (God classes)

❌ Hard-coded values

❌ Poor naming

❌ Difficult to refactor safely

🧠 Legacy Code in LLD Context

In LLD interviews, legacy code means:

“You are given an existing system. You must add features without breaking existing behavior.”

They test:

Design principles

Refactoring skills

Backward compatibility

Risk handling

🛠 How Do We Handle Legacy Code? (VERY IMPORTANT)
1️⃣ Don’t Rewrite Everything ❌

Too risky

May break production

2️⃣ Add Tests First ✅

“Tests are a safety net”

Write unit tests around current behavior

Even if code is ugly

3️⃣ Refactor Incrementally

Small changes

One method at a time

4️⃣ Use Design Patterns to Isolate It

Common patterns used:

Adapter → Wrap legacy code

Facade → Simplify interface

Strategy → Replace if-else

Decorator → Add behavior without modification

🧩 Legacy Code → Clean Design (Example)
Legacy
if (type == 1) { ... }

Improved (Strategy Pattern)
PaymentStrategy strategy = factory.get(type);
strategy.pay();


Legacy code stays, new code wraps it.

🎯 Interview One-Liner Answer

Legacy code is existing production code that works but is difficult to understand, maintain, or extend safely.

🧠 Real-World Example (Relatable)

Banking systems (10–20 years old)

Telecom billing systems

Government software

Old monolithic enterprise apps

⚠️ Important Interview Tip

Never say:

“I will rewrite the whole code”

Instead say:

“I will refactor incrementally with tests and patterns”
